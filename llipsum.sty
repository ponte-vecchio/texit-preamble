  ``Sitting among the gleaming steel fixtures and softly-glowing concrete lines of the modernist {\itshape Flughafen K\"oln/Bonn\/} on a sunny Sunday morning in late 1977, en route to his homebase, the perennially nervous flier recoiled once again at the canned pop pleasantries mindless piped into such an inspired space. The music was not only an afterthought but also insulting to the idea that you would soon climb into a sleep metal tube and be propelled by engines through the sky at 40\narrowspace*{}000 feet. ``I started thinking\emdash{}{\slshape`What should we be hearing here?'\/} I thought most of all you wanted music that didn't try to pretend that you weren't going to die on the plane,'' Eno, laughing but serious.''
